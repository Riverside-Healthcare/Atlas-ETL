Schedule
########


Once the ETL's are published to SSRS they can easily be scheduled to run on intervals.

1. Create a new job

   .. list-table::

      * - .. figure:: ../images/schedule/create_job.png
             :alt: create job

2. Give the job a name

   .. list-table::

      * - .. figure:: ../images/schedule/name_job.png
             :alt: name job

3. Add a step to the job, specifying the ETL.

   .. list-table::

      * - .. figure:: ../images/schedule/schedule_choose_job.png
             :alt: create job step

   .. note:: At this step, choose the domain account that has read access to all data source and write access to the ``atlas-staging`` db.

4. Create a schedule

   .. list-table::

      * - .. figure:: ../images/schedule/schedule_job.png
             :alt: create schedule
